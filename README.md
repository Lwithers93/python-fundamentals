# Python Fundamentals

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and small projects completed as part of a structured Python bootcamp, alongside additional independent practice. The work focuses on core Python language features, problem-solving, and basic data processing patterns.

## Repository Structure

### tasks

A collection of smaller exercises completed during the bootcamp to practise Python fundamentals such as control flow, functions, and working with data.

### main-projects

A set of more complete projects and small games, completed either as part of the bootcamp or independently to reinforce learning and apply concepts in a practical context.

## Testing

Basic pytest tests are included for some projects to validate expected behaviour. These tests demonstrate mocking of user input and randomness to test interactive scripts (see the `rock-paper-scissors` project).
